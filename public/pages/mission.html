                    <p>
                        The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, delivering resources that advance computing as a science and a profession.
                         ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                      The East Carolina University ACM Student Chapter strives to provide a community whereby those with a common interest in computing are encouraged to work
                       together and learn from each other while preparing for careers as computer professionals.

                 Hackathons
              </h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                The ECU ACM Chapter occasionally participates in local Hackathons that are hosted each semester. We offer rides for those don't have cars, and also offer quick meetings before these events to go over what one should do if they
                have never been to a Hackathon before. At these events members will be able to work together to create things such as Web / Mobile Applications and have fun working together. In addition to that, this is also a good oppurtunity 
                for members to netowrk with the present companies that typically show up at Hackathons for a chace at landing an interview for a job or internship.

                Workshops
              </h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                The club also hosts workshops during both the Fall and Spring semesters to teach members of the club new technologies such as NodeJS or AngularJS so that they can implement these into their own personal / work projects.
                We want our members to be well equipped prior to graduation, so we host these events so that we can prepare them efficiently for what's expected of them after graduation.

            <p>
              Guest speakers will also make appearances to talk about various things such as their own project, or even to inform prospective attendees about a specific technology.

                    <p>
                      We plan trips to visit companies such as IBM and Cisco within RTP. It's a good oppurtunity
                      to network and learn more about differnt companies.
